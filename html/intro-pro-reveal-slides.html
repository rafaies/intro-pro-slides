<p>Memory, Primary Memory or RAM (Random Access Memory).</p>

<p>This rapid-access, relatively low-capacity “warehouse” section retains information that has been entered through the <strong>input unit</strong>, making it immediately available for processing when needed. The memory unit also retains processed information until it can be placed on output devices by the <strong>output unit</strong>. Information in the memory unit is <strong>volatile</strong> (lost when the computer’s power is turned off).</p>
</section><section id="alu" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> ALU</h2>
<p>The <strong>Arithmetic and Logic Unit</strong> performs <em>calculations</em>, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. It also contains the <em>decision</em> mechanisms that allow the computer, for example, to compare two items from the memory unit to determine whether they’re equal.</p>
<p>In today’s systems, the <strong>ALU</strong> is implemented as part of the next logical unit, the <strong>CPU</strong>.</p>
</section><section id="cpu" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> CPU</h2>
<p>The <strong>Central Processing Unit</strong> coordinates and supervises the operation of the other sections. The <strong>CPU</strong> tells the <em>input unit</em> when information should be read into the <em>memory unit</em>, tells the <em>ALU</em> when information from the <em>memory unit</em> should be used in calculations and tells the <em>output unit</em> when to send information from the <em>memory unit</em> to certain <em>output devices</em>.</p>
<p>A <strong>multicore processor</strong> implements multiple processors on a single integrated-circuit chip and, hence, can perform many operations simultaneously.</p>
</section><section id="secondary-storage-unit-i" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Secondary storage unit (I)</h2>
<p>This is the <em>long-term</em>, <em>high-capacity</em> “warehousing” section.</p>
<p>Programs or data not actively being used by the other units normally are placed on secondary storage devices (e.g., your hard drive) until they’re again needed.</p>
<p>Information on secondary storage devices is <strong>persistent</strong> (it’s preserved even when the computer’s power is turned off).</p>
</section><section id="secondary-storage-unit-ii" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.9</span> Secondary storage unit (II)</h2>
<p>Secondary storage information takes much longer to access than information in primary memory, but its cost per unit is much less.</p>
<p>Examples of secondary storage devices include solid-state drives (SSDs), hard drives, DVD drives and USB flash drives, some of which can hold over 2 TB (TB stands for terabytes).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Bits</h2>
<p>A <strong>bit</strong> (short for <strong>“binary digit”</strong>) is the smallest data item in a computer (take value 0 or 1).</p>
<p>Data items processed by computers form a data hierarchy that becomes larger and more complex in structure as we progress from the simplest data items (<strong>bits</strong>) to richer ones, such as <strong>characters</strong> and <strong>fields</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s tedious for people to work with data in the low-level form of bits. Instead, they prefer to work with decimal digits (0-9), letters (A-Z and a-z), and special symbols (e.g., $, @, %, &amp;, *, (, ), –, +, &quot;, :, ? and /).</p>
<img data-src="../img/data-hierarchy.png" title="fig:Data Hierarchy" alt="Data Hierarchy" class="stretch" />
</section><section id="characters-i" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Characters (I)</h2>
<p>Digits, letters and special symbols are known as <strong>characters</strong>.</p>
<p>Computer’s character set: all the characters used to write programs and represent data items.</p>
<p>Computers process only 1s and 0s, so a computer’s character set represents every character as a pattern of 1s and 0s.</p>
</section><section id="characters-ii" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Characters (II)</h2>
<p><strong>Java</strong> uses <a href="https://unicode.org/"><strong>Unicode</strong></a> characters that are composed of one, two or four bytes (8, 16 or 32 bits).</p>
<p><strong>Unicode</strong> contains characters for many of the world’s languages</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII"><strong>ASCII</strong></a> (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set is the popular subset of Unicode that represents uppercase and lowercase letters, digits and some common special characters.</p>
</section><section id="fields" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Fields</h2>
<p>Just as characters are composed of bits, <strong>fields</strong> are composed of characters or bytes.</p>
<p>A <strong>field</strong> is a group of characters or bytes that conveys meaning. For example, a field consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters can be used to represent a person’s name, and a field cosisting of decimal digits could represent a person’s age.</p>
</section><section id="records-i" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.5</span> Records (I)</h2>
<p>A <strong>record</strong> is a group of related fields (implemented as a <strong>class</strong> in Java).</p>
<p><strong>Example: payroll system</strong>. The record for an employee might consist of the following fields (possible types for these fields are shown in parentheses):</p>
<ul>
<li>Employee identification number (a whole number)</li>
<li>Name (a string of characters)</li>
<li>Address (a string of characters)</li>
<li>Hourly pay rate (a number with a decimal point)</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.7</span> Files</h2>
<p>A <strong>file</strong> is a <strong>group of related records</strong>.</p>
<p>More generally, a file contains arbitrary data in arbitrary formats. In some operating systems, a file is viewed simply as a <em>sequence of bytes</em>. Any organization of the bytes in a file, such as organizing the data into records, is a view created by the application programmer.</p>
<p>It’s not unusual for an organization to have many files, some containing billions, or even trillions, of characters of information.</p>
</section><section id="database" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.8</span> Database</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>database</strong> is a collection of data organized for easy access and manipulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most popular model is the <strong>relational database</strong>, in which data is stored in simple tables. A <strong>table</strong> includes <strong>records</strong> and <strong>fields</strong>.</p>
</section><section id="big-data" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.9</span> Big Data</h2>
<p>The amount of data being produced worldwide is enormous and growing quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Big data</strong> applications deal with massive amounts of data and this field is growing quickly, creating lots of opportunity for software developers.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Assembly Languages and Assemblers</h2>
<p>Programming in machine language was simply too slow and tedious for most programmers.</p>
<p>Programmers began using English-like abbreviations to represent elementary operations. These abbreviations formed the basis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language"><strong>assembly languages</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Assemblers</strong> (translator programs) were developed to convert early assembly-language programs to machine language at computer speeds.</p>
</section><section id="high-level-languages-and-compilers" class="slide level2">

<p>To speed the programming process, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language"><strong>high-level languages</strong></a> were developed in which single statements could be written to accomplish substantial tasks.</p>
<p>High-level languages allow you to write instructions that look almost like everyday English and contain commonly used mathematical notations.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler"><strong>Compilers</strong></a> convert high-level language programs into machine language. <a href="https://labs.jensimmons.com/2016/examples/grace-hopper-page.html"><strong>Grace Hopper</strong></a> invented the first compiler in the early 1950s.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Objects (I)</h2>
<p><strong>Objects</strong>, or more precisely, the <strong>classes</strong> objects come from, are essentially <strong>reusable</strong> software components.</p>
<p>There are date objects, time objects, audio objects, video objects, automobile objects, people objects, etc.</p>
<p>Almost any <strong>noun</strong> can be reasonably represented as a software object in terms of <strong>attributes</strong> (e.g., name, color and size) and <strong>behaviors</strong> (e.g., calculating, moving and communicating).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Objects (II)</h2>

<p>Let’s use the car example to introduce some key object-oriented programming concepts.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Performing a task in a program requires a <strong>method</strong>.</li>
<li class="fragment">The method houses the program statements that actually perform its tasks.</li>
<li class="fragment">The method <strong>hides</strong> these statements from its user, just as the accelerator pedal of a car hides from the driver the mechanisms of making the car go faster.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section><section id="methods-and-classes-ii" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.7</span> Methods and Classes (II)</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Java, we create a program unit called a <strong>class</strong> to house the set of methods that perform the class’s tasks.</li>
<li>A class is similar in concept to a car’s engineering drawings, which house the design of an accelerator pedal, steering wheel, and so on.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="instantiation" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.8</span> Instantiation</h2>
<p>Just as someone has to <em>build a car</em> from its engineering drawings before you can actually drive a car, you must <strong>build an object</strong> of a class before a program can perform the tasks that the class’s methods define.</p>
<p>The process of doing this is called <strong>instantiation</strong>.</p>
<p>An object is then referred to as an <strong>instance</strong> of its class.</p>
</section><section id="reuse-i" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.9</span> Reuse (I)</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Just as a car’s engineering drawings can be <em>reused</em> many times to build many cars, you can <strong>reuse a class</strong> many times to build many objects.</li>
<li class="fragment">Reuse of existing classes when building new classes and programs saves time and effort.</li>
<li class="fragment">Reuse also helps you build more reliable and effective systems, because existing classes and components often have undergone extensive <em>testing, debugging and performance</em> tuning.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section><section id="reuse-ii" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.10</span> Reuse (II)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just as the notion of <em>interchangeable parts</em> was crucial to the Industrial Revolution, reusable classes are crucial to the software revolution that has been spurred by object technology.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Use a building-block approach to creating your programs. Avoid reinventing the wheel, use existing high-quality pieces wherever possible. This software reuse is a key benefit of object-oriented programming.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.11</span> Messages and Method Calls</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">When you drive a car, pressing its gas pedal sends a <strong>message</strong> to the car to perform a task, that is, to go faster.</li>
<li class="fragment">Similarly, you <strong>send messages to an object</strong>.</li>
<li class="fragment">Each message is implemented as a <strong>method call</strong> that tells a method of the object to perform its task.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section><section id="attributes-and-instance-variables-i" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.12</span> Attributes and Instance Variables (I)</h2>
<ul>
<li>A car has attributes (color, number of doors, amount of gas in its tank, its current speed, …)</li>
<li>The car’s attributes are represented as part of its design in its engineering diagrams.</li>
<li>Every car maintains its own attributes.</li>
<li>For example, each car knows how much gas is in its own gas tank, but not how much is in the tanks of other cars.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="attributes-and-instance-variables-ii" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.13</span> Attributes and Instance Variables (II)</h2>
<ul>
<li>An object has attributes that it carries along as it’s used in a program.</li>
<li>These attributes are specified as part of the object’s class.</li>
<li>For example, a bank-account object has a balance attribute that represents the amount of money in the account. Each bank-account object knows the balance in the account it represents, but not the balances of the other accounts in the bank.</li>
<li>Attributes are specified by the class’s <strong>instance variables</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.14</span> Encapsulation and Information Hiding</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Classes (and their objects) <strong>encapsulate</strong>, i.e., encase, their attributes and methods. A class’s (and its object’s) attributes and methods are intimately related.</li>
<li class="fragment">Objects may communicate with one another, but they’re normally not allowed to know how other objects are implemented, implementation details can be <em>hidden</em> within the objects themselves.</li>
<li class="fragment">This <strong>information hiding</strong>, as we’ll see, is crucial to good software engineering.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.15</span> Inheritance</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A new class of objects can be created conveniently by <strong>Inheritance</strong>, the new class (called the <strong>subclass</strong>) starts with the characteristics of an existing class (called the <strong>superclass</strong>), possibly customizing them and adding unique characteristics of its own.</p></li>
<li><p>In our car analogy, an object of class “convertible” certainly is an object of the more general class “automobile”, but more specifically, the roof can be raised or lowered.</p></li>

</section><section id="interfaces-i" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.16</span> Interfaces (I)</h2>
<p>Java also supports <strong>interfaces</strong>, collections of related methods that typically enable you to tell objects <strong>what</strong> to do, but not <strong>how</strong> to do it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A “basic-driving capabilities” interface consisting of a steering wheel, an accelerator pedal and a brake pedal would enable a driver to tell the car what to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you know how to use this interface for turning, accelerating and braking, you can drive many types of cars, even though manufacturers may implement these systems differently.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.1</span> ARPANET (I)</h2>
<p>In the late 1960s, <strong>ARPA</strong>—the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the United States Department of Defense—rolled out plans for networking the main computer systems of approximately a dozen ARPA-funded universities and research institutions.</p>
<p>The computers were to be connected with communications lines operating at speeds on the order of 50,000 bits per second, a stunning rate at a time when most people (of the few who even had networking access) were connecting over telephone lines to computers at a rate of 110 bits per second.</p>
</section><section id="arpanet-ii" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> ARPANET (II)</h2>
<p>Academic research was about to take a giant leap forward.</p>
<p>ARPA proceeded to implement what quickly became known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET"><strong>ARPANET</strong></a>, the precursor to today’s Internet.</p>
<p>Things worked out differently from the original plan.</p>
<p>Although the ARPANET enabled researchers to network their computers, its main benefit proved to be the capability for quick and easy communication via what came to be known as electronic mail (<strong>e-mail</strong>).</p>
</section><section id="arpanet-iii" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.3</span> ARPANET (III)</h2>
<p>This is true even on today’s Internet, with e-mail, instant messaging, file transfer and social media such as Facebook and Twitter enabling billions of people worldwide to communicate quickly and easily.</p>
<p>The protocol (set of rules) for communicating over the ARPANET became known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol"><strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</strong></a>. TCP ensured that messages, consisting of sequentially numbered pieces called <strong>packets</strong>, were properly routed from sender to receiver, arrived intact and were assembled in the correct order.</p>
</section><section id="internet-a-network-of-networks-i" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.4</span> Internet: A Network of Networks (I)</h2>
<p>In parallel with the early evolution of the Internet, organizations worldwide were implementing their own networks for both <em>intraorganization</em> (that is, within an organization) and <em>interorganization</em> (that is, between organizations) communication.</p>
<p>A huge variety of <em>networking hardware and software</em> appeared. One challenge was to <strong>enable these different networks to communicate with each other</strong>.</p>
</section><section id="internet-a-network-of-networks-ii" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.5</span> Internet: A Network of Networks (II)</h2>
<p>ARPA accomplished this by developing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol"><strong>Internet Protocol (IP)</strong></a>, which created a true “network of networks”, the current architecture of the Internet.</p>
<p>The combined set of protocols is now called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite"><strong>TCP/IP</strong></a>. Each Internet-connected device has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address"><strong>IP address</strong></a>—a unique numerical identifier used by devices communicating via TCP/IP to locate one another on the Internet.</p>
</section><section id="internet-a-network-of-networks-iii" class="slide level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.6</span> Internet: A Network of Networks (III)</h2>
<p>Businesses rapidly realized that by using the Internet, they could improve their operations and offer new and better services to their clients.<br> Companies started spending large amounts of money to develop and enhance their Internet presence. This generated fierce competition among communications carriers and hardware and software suppliers to meet the increased infrastructure demand.</p>
<p>As a result, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)"><strong>bandwidth</strong></a>—the information-carrying capacity of communications lines—on the Internet has increased tremendously, while hardware costs have plummeted.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"><strong>World Wide Web</strong></a> (simply called “the web”) is a collection of hardware and software associated with the Internet that allows computer users to locate and view documents (with various combinations of text, graphics, animations, audios and videos) on almost any subject.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.8</span> World Wide Web: Making the Internet User-Friendly (II)</h2>
<p>Berners-Lee also wrote communication protocols such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a>) to form the backbone of his new hypertext information system, which he referred to as the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>In 1994, he founded the World Wide Web Consortium <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> devoted to developing web technologies. One of the W3C’s primary goals is to make the web universally accessible to everyone regardless of disabilities, language or culture.</p>
